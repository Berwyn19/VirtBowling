## Project description
We aim to transform a traditional bowling game into an interactive virtual bowling game. A ball will be thrown to a monitor, beneath
which lies a distance sensor to detect where the ball hits the monitor. The monitor will then simulate an animation of falling pins based on 
the information obtained from the distance sensor.

## Hardware, budget
DWEII VL53L1X $15 for 2. We have got the sensor.

## Tasks, member responsibilities
Sazzad Islam - Setting up the sensors and making the system standalone.
Jermaine Zhao - Creates simulation of falling pins with Unity, gathers the necessary frames, and converts the picture into ASCII.
Berwyn - Handles everything related to the graphics such as converting the ASCII into pixels and converting the frames into a dynamic animation.

## Schedule, midpoint milestones
Finish everything related to sensors and, at the very least, complete the creation of a falling pin animation for a single pin.

## Resources needed, issues
The possible risk of this project is speed. We aim to create a smooth animation but the data that we have to handle is huge.
